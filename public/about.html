<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Hi, I'm Srikanth!</h2>
<p>
  I'm a passionate computer science student currently pursuing my BE in the 2nd
  year, specializing in Computer Science Engineering (CSE). I'm highly motivated
  by the ever-evolving world of web development and am actively expanding my
  skillset by delving into a comprehensive full-stack web development course.
</p>

<p>
  This course is equipping me with the knowledge and tools to build robust and
  interactive web applications. I'm excited to learn and explore the back-end
  and front-end aspects of web development, from creating dynamic
  functionalities to crafting user-friendly interfaces.
